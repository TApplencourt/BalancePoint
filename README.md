# BalancePoint

Implementation of balencing technique for data-flow code.

1. The Gao's Linear program formulation (https://doi.org/10.1016/0743-7315(89)90041-5). 
This algorithm generates an optimally balanced graph, that is, a graph that requires a minimum amount of buffering.

2. A minmax approach that balances a graph as well as possible under the constraint of a limited number of buffers.
