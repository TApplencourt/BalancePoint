# BalancePoint

Implementation of balencing technique for data-flow code. 

1. The Gao's Linear program formulation (https://doi.org/10.1016/0743-7315(89)90041-5). 
This algorithm generates an optimally balanced graph, that is, a graph that requires a minimum amount of buffering.

2. The Apple Linear program formulation. This algorithm generates an balanced graph as good as possible given a budget of buffer.
